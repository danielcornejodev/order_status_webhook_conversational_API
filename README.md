Deterministic intent detection and entity extraction for reliability and low latency. The conversational layer orchestrates logic but delegates business functionality to a backend service. Structured responses and logging are included to support observability and monitoring.

This code demonstrates:
    • Clean separation of concerns
    • Deterministic intent logic
    • Regex-based entity extraction
    • Mock backend service
    • Structured response models
    • Logging
    • Graceful error handling
    • Production-minded fallback
No unnecessary LLM
